[2026-02-14T18:39:05.082488] Processing: Manager, initiate 'Operation: Self-Healing'. 

GOAL: Build an automated cleanup script for the '.agent-jobs/' directory. 
1. ARCHITECT: Design a Python script that identifies folders older than 48 hours and moves them to a 'compressed_archives' folder.
2. ENGINEER: Write the script as 'scripts/auto_cleanup.py'.
3. TESTER: Create a dummy folder in '.agent-jobs/' with an old timestamp and verify the script moves it correctly.
4. GOVERNANCE: Present the 'Consolidated Brief' for my approval before any files are moved.

This is a live End-to-End test. Report on Specialist responsiveness and CPU load during the build.
