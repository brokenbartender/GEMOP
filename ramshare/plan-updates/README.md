# Plan Updates (Pending)

This folder is a staging area for proposed updates to the living plan:
- Living plan: `ramshare/progressive-plan.md`

Workflow:
1. During distillation, Gemini can append concrete, repo-specific "net-new decisions" into:
   - `ramshare/plan-updates/pending.md` (gitignored)
2. Review and manually merge the useful parts into `ramshare/progressive-plan.md`.

Rationale:
- Avoids auto-editing the plan in a noisy/duplicative way.
- Keeps plan edits deliberate while still capturing actionable outcomes during distillation.
